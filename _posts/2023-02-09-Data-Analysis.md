Here you will find the [Data](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aly9cvPU2x-Ik0uZsT4dY7kN4xc6?e=UDgwtu) I used to make the following graphs.

The *Bar Graph* above shows the comparisson between the minimum and maximum temperatures reached for 27 laps of an individual running with a garmin watch!

This graph compares the <span style="color:blue">average speed </span> with the <span style="color:orange">average moving speed </span>.
Accoding to [Garmin](https://www.garmin.com/en-CA/) the average speed is based off the time value, while the average moving speed is based off the moving time value, which removes the time the individal is stopped.This might explain why the average moving speed is higher than the average speed.
